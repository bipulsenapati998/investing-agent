4. **AI Coaching with Personalized Action Plans:**
   - Enhance the AI coaching feature to include personalized action plans with specific exercises or practices based on user input and progress. The coach could also facilitate accountability by prompting users to reflect on their experiences and achievements.

7. **Wearable Device Integration and Real-time Insights:**
   - Expand integration with wearables to include customizable alerts for users based on physiological data (e.g., reminders to practice mindfulness when stress levels spike). Provide insights that correlate physical health with mental well-being.

8. **Gamification and Engagement Strategies:**
   - Introduce social elements where users can share achievements or milestones with friends or community members. Create friendly competitions or challenges that encourage consistent engagement with the app.
